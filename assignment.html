       <h3>Marketing channels of OUR game:</h3>
        
        <p>Airlines are part of the service industry, competing to offer the best experience of several similar competitors. As such, marketing including an airline
 advertising strategy, social media, and other programs can make the difference between gaining customers or losing out to other airlines. To attract the 
most customers and generate buzz, airlines must remain enticing and competitive. Here are four of the best strategies for marketing airlines.By creating a
 loyalty program, you will encourage fliers to become repeat customers, booking additional flights with your business. Most airlines will charge the same 
fare for identical trips. By letting a customer become eligible for perks by earning points, you can gain an advantage over the competition. Perks can
 range from seat upgrades to free flights, airport lounge passes, or discounted parking spaces. Be creative and you’ll find that loyalty program members
 may book exclusively with you to maximize their benefits.Thinking outside the box for advertising can help you work your way into your customers’ daily
 lives. The best airline advertising campaigns are a combination of traditional and non-traditional, so in addition to online and print marketing, make 
your presence known in the community.</p>
        <h3>Monetization strategies of OUR game:</h3>
        <p>The monetization stage seeks to translate non-paying users into paying users and encourage paying users to repeat their purchases. This is the core of 
how to generate revenue but all these three stages are interrelated and interact and need to keep dynamic equilibrium.
Profitability = Number of players * Percentage of paying users (conversion rate) * The amount of money spent each month. 
The main issue we need to explore when it comes to monetization strategies is how to balance delivering value to players, keeping games fun and maximizing 
profitability.</p>
